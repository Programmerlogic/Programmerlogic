BFS-DFS Code implementation.

Three types of inputs are accepted:-
* Enter a matrix in runtime
* Enter the data of the connected vertices in the graph
* Write a matrix in a text file and take the file as an input matrix

Queue is used for implementing the algorithm of BFS.
Stack is used for implementing the algorithm of DFS.
